Esotérica Tropical (2024)
</h2>
<p>
Queer Boricua bruja Esotérica Tropical is set to release her latest single ‘Pequeños Milagros’, a sensual space dub, on July 11th in the good company of ‘Realismo Mágico’ a joy inducing banger, both celebrating queer magic as part of her forthcoming debut album ‘Esotérica Tropical’.
</p>
<h3 align="left">About Pequeños Milagros:</h3>
<p>"Pequeños Milagros" unfolds as an enchanting exploration of sonic space, infused with velvety warm deep vocals, heavenly harp and harmonies that resonate with intimacy and introspection. Esotérica Tropical's mystical lyrics and smooth melodies evoke a sense of presence and ecstatic awareness, inviting listeners to slow down, tune in, and embrace the beauty of life's fleeting moments. 
</p>
<p>
The track is set against a backdrop of lush atmospheric soundscapes produced by Luis Maurette (of Uji and Lulacruza) that weaves together elements of old time bolero songs layered in delayed rich harp.
</p>
<p>
"This song is a celebration of the senses, an ode to moving beyond longing into a state of ecstatic open awareness," explains Esotérica Tropical. "It's about discovering the little miracles in everyday life, finding pleasure in the present moment, and embracing the cosmic body within us."

<h3 align="left">About Realismo Mágico:</h3>
<p>
“Realismo Mágico” features production contributions from Atropolis and vocals from Merrill Garbus of TuneYards.
</p>
<p>
The song is also a celebration of queer magic - dedicated to the authenticity and the beautiful strangeness that resides in the margins. It touches on the dynamic between love and freedom, the power of choice, agency, with the awareness of the ephemeral nature of life.
</p>
<p>
Musically, the song is carried by a tropical and infectious pulsating baseline as Esotérica Tropical’s impactful voice guides alongside an unconventional and captivating melody. Vocals from Tuneyards’ Merrill Garbus can be heard wafting throughout the song, adding undeniable depth. ‘Realismo Mágico’ is part of the forthcoming album Esotérica Tropical, part love-letter to Puerto Rico, part balm to ease the deep pain of constant oppression and the intergenerational wounds of colonization- made to make imagining a different world feel more possible than it was before.
</p>
<p>
The music video for  ‘Realismo Mágico’ was directed by Ana Paula Teixeira, a Brazilian/Puerto Rican queer nonbinary filmmaker and photographer whose work poignantly captures the escapism of the queer community in the Caribbean. It was filmed in Puerto Rico - in La Perla and El Malecón de Cataño. 
</p>
<p>
‘Realismo Mágico’ is an ode to the magic of the ordinary - a way of perceiving that is full of wonder and appreciation of the magic in all things. There is something childlike and innocent about being able to tap into these dimensions that are always here, where wonder and awe recide. Were spirits from the beyond guide us and bless us with light, joy, and levity. These are ancient practices that support our communal wellbeing, through connection to the unseen, ceremony and celebration. Archetypes our deepest joy and authenticity longs for us to embody,” says Esotérica Tropical about the song.

“Very beautiful song, a very innovative concept, very nice voice”
<br>
<b> - Felix Contreras, NPR’s Alt Latino</b>

“(Esotérica Tropical’s) luminous voice and powerful lyrics do not miss a beat.”

<p>
Esotérica Tropical, a queer Boricua bruja, defies boundaries with her showstopping voice, intuitive folk harp, Afro-Puerto Rican Bomba rhythms, and electronic innovation. Her music challenges colonial mentality while championing sovereignty and surrealism. In 2009, destiny bestowed a Celtic harp upon Esotérica Tropical on a Puerto Rican beach, sparking her transformation from an acupuncturist into a genre-blurring musical magician. Esotérica draws on her 20 years of experience as a healer in her ritualistic and transformative performances which have graced renowned venues and festivals internationally, including Oakland Museum, MACLA, Yerba Buena Gardens Festival, The Chapel, Teatro Municipal de Cusco, Festival Color Caribe, and Brava Theater. In 2022, she released a collaboration with Argentinian producer Chancha Via Circuito on his highly anticipated album  "La Estrella" on Wonderwheel Recordings.

Album Release:
</h3>
<p>
{September 6, 2024} The self-titled debut album of Esotérica Tropical, embodies freedom and resistance in times of struggle, transforming the scars of living within an endless crisis into a beautiful, celebratory, and defiant experience. Conceived and written after migrating to Oakland, California, Esotérica Tropical was inspired by the shared diasporic longing of many Puerto Ricans around the world to return to their place of birth. It's ten songs collate a collection of love letters to Puerto Rico from our essence to our bodies and the land, tapping into our ancestral roots to the power of remembrance.
</p>
<p>

The album also features contributions from the indie music powerhouse Merrill Garbus of Tune-Yards ("Realismo Mágico"), Julia Cepeda and Denise Solis of Taller Bombaléle, on all bomba-based songs, in addition to Julia's father, Jesús "El Tambor Mayor" Cepeda ("Huracán"); and the Argentine singer-songwriter, producer, and arranger, Juanito El Cantor-de La Nube Mágica ("Silencio").
