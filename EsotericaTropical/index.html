Esotérica Tropical (2024)
</h2>
<p>
María José Montijo’s debut album, Esotérica Tropical, embodies freedom and resistance in times of strife, turning the scars of living in neverending crisis into a beautiful, joyous, and combative experience.
</p>
<p>
Conceived and written after having relocated to Oakland, CA for an extended period, Esotérica Tropical was inspired by the diasporic longing shared by countless Puerto Ricans around the globe of wanting to return to their birthplace. It's ten songs form a collection of love letters to Puerto Rico, to the essence of who we are, to our bodies and the land, to our ancestors and the power of remembering.
</p>
<p>
“Esotérica Tropical is a term gifted to me by a dear friend, that helps describe the internal ecosystem that makes it possible for me to create the kind of music that I do –music that is medicinal, political, and very earnest. It’s listening to the ocean, the river, the earth, the wind, the trees, the rocks, and the ancestors. It’s feeling the elements and the cycles of the natural world around and inside me. It’s the intoxicating sounds of the coquíes at night, the wetness of the air, the salty smell of the sea breeze, the deep aliveness one feels when plunging into cold river water. It’s leaning into the mystery of life and ancestral healing techniques to transform pain into joy.”
</p>
<p>
Esotérica Tropical was recorded at the Zoo Labs Studios in Oakland beginning in the fall of 2019 until December of 2020. Zoo Labs is a non-profit artist incubator offering mentorship programs and grants to BIPOC. As an alum and two-time grant recipient, María José was able to produce and lay down most of the acoustic tracks for her album at Zoo Labs –including bomba rhythms; cuatro, bass, and clarinet sessions; and a quartet. These sessions were complemented with additional background vocals and drums that Majo recorded at home during the pandemic, after her brother Jorge –a sound engineer based in Los Angeles– taught her Pro Tools.
</p>
<p>
The resulting sound of Esotérica Tropical is eclectic, melding these acoustic performances and traditional bomba rhythms with electronic flourishes and modern production courtesy of a trio of collaborators: Luis Maurette (Uji, Lulacruza), Heidi Lewandowski (Kaleema), and Adam Partridge (Atropolis). It also features contributions from indie music powerhouse Merrill Garbus from Tune-Yards (“Realismo Mágico”),  Julia Cepeda and Denise Solis from Taller Bombaléle in all bomba based tracks, as well as Julia’s father, Jesús “El Tambor Mayor” Cepeda (“Huracán”); Bay Area Latin jazz virtuoso Charlie Gurke (“Huracán”); and Argentinean songwriter Juanito El Cantor of La Nube Mágica (“Silencio”).; and indie music powerhouse Merrill Garbus from Tune-Yards (“Realismo Mágico”).

“Esotérica Tropical is a tribute to all the inner work and healing I’ve done –not only to survive, but to learn to thrive and help others in their own healing journeys. These songs and the performances that I am designing around them are meant specially for QTBIPOC to heal, nourish, and replenish from the constant oppression and intergenerational wounds of colonization. My hope is that these songs can help people digest their pain and move towards more authenticity, integrity, alignement, and sovereignty.”

María José Montijo
</p>
<p>
Singer-songwriter Esotérica Tropical draws inspiration from over 20 years of experience as a healer –including tai-chi and qi-gong practice, daoist cosmology, meditation, and studying bodywork, and practicing traditional medicine and acupuncture. Her music is rooted in a continuous process of discovery and care, where trauma is transformed into art.
</p>
<p>
“My songs come from a deep state of listening and meditation –a communion with nature, while at the river, the beach, or staring at a tree or the sky; or from a very emotive disposition, like the grief over my paternal grandmother’s death and the rage I feel from being a colonial subject. They help me remember my essence, the love and care that is available, the strength of my ancestors, and my own agency.”  
</p>
<p>
A self-described “weird, cosmic, and queer islander” from Puerto Rico, Esotérica’s musical journey began as a student of classical vocal performance in Puerto Rico’s prestigious Conservatory of Music. After a series of health issues derailed her music studies, Esotérica began treatment for Hashimoto’s disease in 2009, including daily swims at San Juan’s El Escambrón beach. It was there that on one fateful day, Esotérica was approached by the lifeguard on duty ––to her surprise, her friend Constanza, a violinist she’d met during her conservatory days. While catching up, Esotérica confessed to her friend she had begun making up songs in the shower, and the very next day Constanza had gifted Esotérica her first harp (one she had bought on eBay, curiously enough, from Puerto Rican composer Angélica Negrón, also a member of the influential indie pop group Balún). “Constanza showed me how to place my fingers on the harp, that the red colored strings were C and the blue colored strings were F, and that was that. I started to write songs intuitively on it.”
</p>
<p>
That chance encounter led to Esotérica’s first collection of songs, the self-released Glaciar EP (2016). “Music gives us something to aspire to. That's why I say my songs are like enchantments or spells –they help me to envision and conjure the world I want to live in.” Her next musical vision would be conjured up while living in Oakland, California, where she fell in love with the Afro-Puerto Rican musical tradition known as bomba. Studying under the tutelage of Julia Cepeda (a member of the legendary Cepeda family) and Denise Solis at Taller Bombaléle, Esotérica experienced playing songs as part of a collective –in community and for the community. 
</p>
<p>
As a result, Esotérica Tropical’s self-titled debut album, Esotérica Tropical (2024), bears a deep bomba influence, both in its rhythms and collaborative nature. Conceived as a love letter to Puerto Rico from the diaspora, the album features performances by Julia and Denise from Taller Bombaléle in all bomba based tracks, as well as Julia’s father, Jesús “El Tambor Mayor” Cepeda (“Huracán”); Bay Area Latin jazz virtuoso Charlie Gurke (“Huracán”); Argentinean songwriter Juanito El Cantor of La Nube Mágica (“Silencio”); and indie music powerhouse Merrill Garbus from Tune-Yards (“Realismo Mágico”). The album also features production by electronic music masterminds Luis Maurette (Uji, Lulacraza), Heidi Lewandowski (Kaleema), and Adam Partridge (Atropolis). The result is an album full of healing songs meant to nourish and replenish us from constant oppression and the intergenerational wounds of colonization –a soundtrack for liberatory practices and joyous moods; a space for ritual and ceremony through song and dance. 
</p>
<p>
“There is an urgency to the music that I make because it is art that supports the process of imagining a different world into being, while building bridges between Puerto Rico and its diaspora. My hope for this project is that it leads to further cross-cultural collaborative opportunities in the Bay Area, Puerto Rico, Latin America, and Europe while helping to connect Puerto Rican decolonization to the myriad struggles of QBIPOC throughout.”
